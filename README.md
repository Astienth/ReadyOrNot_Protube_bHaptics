# <b>Installation</b></br>

THE VR MOD IS REQUIRED !

1) Download the zip file from [https://github.com/Astienth/ReadyOrNot_Protube_bHaptics/releases/download/1.0.0/RON_bHaptics_Protube.zip](https://github.com/Astienth/ReadyOrNot_Protube_bHaptics/releases/download/1.0.0/RON_bHaptics_Protube.zip) </br>
2) Extract its content into the **game root folder\ReadyOrNot\Binaries\Win64**, the folder containing the ReadyOrNotSteam-Win64-Shipping.exe.</br>
3) Launch bhaptic player and turn your devices on if you use bHaptics. Turn your protube device on if you use protube devices</br>
4) Launch the game like you usually launch it.
5) A command line window should open, this is the bhaptics udp server used by the mod, don't close it :)

If you already installed a previous version of the mod, you can just overwrite everything.

# <b>Uninstall</b></br>
Rename the file ReadyOrNot\Binaries\Win64\dwmapi.dll to something else, like "dwmapi_bak.dll" for example
